% CORTEX_AMPA: Generates the panels of Figure 10.
%   Comparison of cortical 100-to-1 circuits, exhibiting 1) FFE projections
%   to cortical cell only, 2) FFE projections to inhibitory interneuron
%   and cortical cell + FFI projection from interneuron to cortical cell,
%   or 3) Same as 2, but with AMPA only inputs to inhibitory interneuron
